# task-manager
A task or ticket management system built with Spring Boot and React.   

We can run the application with the following commands (from inside the `task-manager` directory):
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
The latter command can only be run is `maven` has been installed on the laptop or system. The first command uses the maven wrapper, i.e. `./mvnw` which gets created during the generation of a Spring Boot project.
